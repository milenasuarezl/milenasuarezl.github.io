<h1>Hi! I'm Milena Suarez</h1>
<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
<articule>
	I’m a Telematic Engineer from Colombia and Senior Web UI Developer at Globant. I have been working for 9 years in software development. I love it!. About the community work, I started with BogotaJS in 2016 as a speaker and after that, I have the opportunity to be one leader of the community, AngelHack Ambassador and JSConf co-organizer. Currently, I have been a speaker of events like Women Tech Maker, BogotaJS, Rails Girls Bogotá, Angular Colombia and Women that Build (Globant community).  My purpose is to inspire women to do things go out of the box creating a support network and sharing the knowledge between us.
